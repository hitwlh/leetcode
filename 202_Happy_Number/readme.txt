202_Happy_Number


题目大意
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
快乐数，就是说对于某一个正整数，如果对其各个位上的数字分别平方，然后再加起来得到一个新的数字，再进行同样的操作，如果最终结果变成了1，则说明是快乐数，

解决方案
直接用一个map去看一下happy的情况就是了，非常简单。

样例
Example: 19 is a happy number

1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100
1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
