268_Missing_Number


题目大意
Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.
For example,
Given nums = [0, 1, 3] return 2.
Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

解决方案
直接求和，然后根据求和公式获得1+...+n，然后减一下就得到了
