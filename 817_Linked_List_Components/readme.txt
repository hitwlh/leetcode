817_Linked_List_Components


题目大意

We are given head, the head node of a linked list containing unique integer values.

We are also given the list G, a subset of the values in the linked list.

Return the number of connected components in G, where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.

求连通组件的数量



解决方案
非常简单，用一个hash表就是了

样例
Example 1:

Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3
G = [0, 1, 3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.
Example 2:

Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3->4
G = [0, 3, 1, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.
