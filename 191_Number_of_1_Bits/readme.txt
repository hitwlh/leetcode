191_Number_of_1_Bits


题目大意
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).



解决方案
直接循环右移，然后看个位是否是1就行了


样例
For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.
